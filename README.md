# GraphQL Restaurant API

This repository houses a simple GraphQL server implementation for managing restaurant data. Users can query individual restaurants, get a list of all restaurants, add new restaurants, edit restaurant details, and delete restaurants.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
3. Run `node index.js` to start the GraphQL server.

## Usage

### Queries

**Fetch a single restaurant by its ID:**
```graphql
{
  restaurant(id: 1) {
    name
    description
    dishes {
      name
      price
    }
  }
}
```

**Fetch all restaurants:**
```graphql
{
  restaurants {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

### Mutations

**Add a new restaurant:**
```graphql
mutation {
  setrestaurant(input: {name: "New Restaurant", description: "New Restaurant Description"}) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
```

**Edit an existing restaurant's name:**
```graphql
mutation {
  editrestaurant(id: 1, name: "Updated Restaurant Name") {
    id
    name
  }
}
```
